# NewWave-script

Here we provide all the scripts needed for Figure 1(B,C,D) and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 of [Agostinis et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.02.453487). The scripts should be run in the numerical order provided by their names.

All the files mentioned in each subsequent script have been created with one `01_DataExtraction.R` and with `19_SupplementaryPlot2.R`.

In order to measure the RAM consumption you need to use a Linux system with [collectl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/collectl) installed.
Files named "MemoryRegisterXXXXX" will run the corresponding file "MemoryXXXXX" and will save the results on a text file.
In order to use `08_plot3.R` you will need to run the corresponding MemoryRegister script 4 times, 1 for each value of "number of cores". Moreover, you need to remember to change the arguments and the name of output files each time.
In order to use `17_plot4.R` you will need to run the corresponding MemoryRegister script 6 times, 1 for each value of "number of cells", you need to remember to change the arguments and the name of output files each time.

In the txt file containing the ram consumption that will be generated by the MemoryRegister files you will need to delete the first row, every occurrance of the line "# PROCESS SUMMARY (counters are /sec)" and the character # before the line of header. This must be done manually for each txt file in order to import them correctly.
